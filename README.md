# Particle-Effect

# Description
This project is built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript with P5.JS library.
Particles move randomly across the screen, connect when close, and come in different colors.
This is inspired by Athena Awards.

# Features
Multi-colored particles with lines
Connecting lines
Different particle sizes

# Motivation
I created this project because the first time I did GWC I learned a little bit about p5.js and decided to go back and learn some more.

# Challenge/Learned
A challenge was to make the particles appear.
I learned how to use p5.js library in a more deeper level.
